https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/vimscript/My article for the website 
https://learnxinyminutes.com/Learn X in Y minutes about Vim scripting has been 
accepted; the article teaches you how to get started with Vim's built-in custom 
scripting language in a very concise manner. It has been quite an enjoyable 
topic to write about and I even ended up learning a few new tricks myself.
