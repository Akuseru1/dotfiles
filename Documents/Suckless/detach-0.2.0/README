This program detaches a program from a terminal so that it can run
independently.  This should be useful when running X programs from a
terminal.  The process can then live longer than the terminal
itself.  This should NOT be used for console applications.  You have been
warned.

Examples of typical usage:
$ detach gimp
$ detach Eterm --shade 50

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.  See COPYING for the

In case you haven't looked at the source code, there is practically
nothing to this program.  I created it for my own use, and you are welcome
to use it if you please.

Thanks to John Coiner for his fix.
