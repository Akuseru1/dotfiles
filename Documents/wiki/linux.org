* Format USB
df and find partition of usb you want to format
sudo umount /dev/sdb1 or the one you have
sudo mkfs.vfat -n 'TV' -I /dev/sdb1
* Multi-Boot
- Use refind boot manager
  its well automated and it accepts themes
- also you need to mount the boot partition in /boot/efi
  for every OS you install, this worked on Solus/Void/Arch
* Arch
** Hardware
*** Mouse

esto habilita el tap del touchpad

Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "mytouchpad"
	driver "libinput"
	option "Tapping" "on"
	option "Clickmethod" "clickfinger"
	EndSection

*** Keyboard-Layout

 put this in a file named /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf 

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "system-keyboard"
        MatchIsKeyboard "on"
        Option "XkbLayout" "latam"
        Option "XkbModel" "pc104"
        Option "XkbVariant" "colemak"
        Option "XkbOptions" "caps:escape"
EndSection

in order to have multiple keyboards you need to make sure you make a script
you run when you connect it,

this script would go more or less like this

**** setxkbmap -layout latam, us -model pc104 -options caps:super, grp:win_space_toggle

also , always search for individual configuration for the respective keyboard

my logitech k400 had an utility called solaar which let you switch the fn state

could have saved many hours

*** External-keyboard-Settings
use solaar for logitech
for deactivating the on state for the fn keys
solaar config 1 fn-swap False
*** Keyboard-codes
xev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf "%-3s %s\n", $5, $8 }'
** Software

failed to synchronise (locked database error)
do this
