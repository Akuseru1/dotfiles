* Fonts
put them in .local/share/fonts
do fc-list to check if they are there and finally do
fc-cache to reload

    + fc-list
    + fc-cache
* Format USB
df and find partition of usb you want to format
sudo umount /dev/sdb1 or the one you have
sudo mkfs.vfat -n 'TV' -I /dev/sdb1
* Multi-Boot
- Use refind boot manager
  its well automated and it accepts themes
- also you need to mount the boot partition in /boot/efi
  for every OS you install, this worked on Solus/Void/Arch
* keyboard 
** gdm
https://askubuntu.com/questions/49651/how-to-change-the-login-screen-keyboard-layout/49658#49658
* Arch
** install
follow videos
ON PACSTRAP /mnt linux
or it wont load the kernel!!!
** Hardware
*** Mouse

 put this in a file named /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf

Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "mytouchpad"
	driver "libinput"
	option "Tapping" "on"
	option "Clickmethod" "clickfinger"
	EndSection

*** Keyboard-Layout

 put this in a file named /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf 

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "system-keyboard"
        MatchIsKeyboard "on"
        Option "XkbLayout" "latam"
        Option "XkbModel" "pc104"
        Option "XkbVariant" "colemak"
        Option "XkbOptions" "caps:escape"
EndSection

in order to have multiple keyboards you need to make sure you make a script
you run when you connect it,

this script would go more or less like this

**** setxkbmap -layout latam, us -model pc104 -options caps:super, grp:win_space_toggle

also , always search for individual configuration for the respective keyboard

my logitech k400 had an utility called solaar which let you switch the fn state

could have saved many hours

*** External-keyboard-Settings
use solaar for logitech
for deactivating the on state for the fn keys
solaar config 1 fn-swap False
*** Keyboard-codes
xev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf "%-3s %s\n", $5, $8 }'
** Software
*** Pacman
**** lock_database
failed to synchronise (locked database error)
do this

rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
*** [[file:Apps.org::Emacs][Emacs]]
**** Dictionaries
Must install from 

sudo pacman -S aspell-es; sudo pacman -S aspell-en
[[file:Semestre_5.org][uni]]

* Solus
** Hardware
*** Mouse
doing the same as arch, freezes keyboard and mouse, the fix is to do the following
put in .xprofile the following line: 
    synclient TapButton1=1
    synclient TapButton2=3
    synclient TapButton3=2
    
or add the following to: /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf


this is the first input class of the file    

    Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "synaptics"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
	      Option "TapButton1" "1"
	      Option "TapButton2" "3"
	      Option "TapButton3" "2"
	      Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "1"
	      Option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "1"
        <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
# This option is recommend on all Linux systems using evdev, but cannot be
# enabled by default. See the following link for details:
# http://who-t.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-to-ignore-configuration-errors.html
#       MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"

*** layout colemak 
**** install colemak in solus

https://github.com/nhermosilla14/latam-colemak

**** enable it
then put this in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "system-keyboard"
        MatchIsKeyboard "on"
        Option "XkbLayout" "latam"
        Option "XkbModel" "pc104"
        Option "XkbVariant" "colemak"
        Option "XkbOptions" "caps:escape"
EndSection
**** make it work in loginscreen
localectl set-x11-keymap latam pc104 colemak

** sudo eopkg up failure 
sudo usysconf run -f ssl-certs
** scripts
most stuff is already done in scripts
** Source .xprofile and .profile by default in lightdm
edit /usr/bin/lightdm-wrapper and source the others
#!/bin/bash

source /usr/share/defaults/etc/profile
source $HOME/.profile
source $HOME/.xprofile

exec $*

** make nvim default EDITOR in ranger and globally
edit the root/.zshrc and /usr/share/defaults/etc/profile
add 
    export EDITOR=nvim
    export VISUAL=nvim
** install dwm
do it normally, then create an .xinitrc
like this: 
    exec mate-session
    #exec dwm
    
if it doesnt work right away check for this:
for error xauth: file /home/user/.serverauth.143
   https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/xauth-file-home-user-serverauth-1436-does-not-exist-4175576123/
you can delete all .Xauthority* files and the .serverauth.143 file
*** lightdm
also run the script for setupDwm 
** Install Packages
sudo eopkg install
sudo eopkg search
** Backup MATE
dconf dump /org/mate/ > ~/.config/dconf-mate-backup
** Load MATE
dconf load / < dconf-full-backup
** media keybindings
in dconf-editor 
org/mate/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys
** make xinitrc work
creating xinitrc in $HOME didnt work
editing /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc didnt work
using solus start up doesnt work with env variables
* Tile Window Managers
** I3
+ i3 size 
  width 1950
  height 1100
** DWM

* bash
** show errors in scripts
# at the beggining
set -e

err_report() {
