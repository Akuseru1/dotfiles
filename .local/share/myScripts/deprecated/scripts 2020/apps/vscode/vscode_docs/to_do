install extension goto-documentation

    Install nodejs and npm
    sudo apt install nodejs npm
    Goto ~/.vscode/extensions/cxfksword.goto-documentation-0.0.1 and install node.js 'opn' package:
    npm install opn
    Edit ~/.vscode/extensions/cxfksword.goto-documentation-0.0.1/out/src/document.js:
    add at the top:
    const opn = require('opn')
    then comment out line:
    this.platform === 'darwin' ? open_darwin(url) : open(url);
    and insert right after:
    opn(url);
    Restart vscode and now try Ctrl+Alt+H (if you don't have any different bindings to this - I had and I had to remove it first) - it should work. The first time is always very slow, but later it works as expected :)
